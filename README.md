master-bookmarklet
==================

An awesome tool for managing your bookmarklets accross devices and browsers.


Usage
-----

You only need to add a single, "master" bookmarklet to each of your browsers. When you use it, a container with all your bookmarklets appears for you to use.

The main advantage of this approach is maintainability - you manage your bookmarklets in a web dashboard, into which you sign in with your Twitter account. When you add or change a bookmarklet, it is instantly avaliable to you in all your browsers.


Running the server
------------------

The app is written in meteor.js. To run it, cd into master-bookmarklet/dashboard and run meteor (you need to have meteor installed). 

Master bookmarklet code is in master-bookmarklet/bookmarklet.js.
