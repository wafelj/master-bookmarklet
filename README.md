master-bookmarklet
==================

An awesome tool for managing your bookmarklets accross devices and browsers.


Usage
-----

You only need to add a single, "master" bookmarklet to any of your browsers. When you execute it, a container with all your bookmarklets appears for you to use.

The main advantage is maintainability - you manage your bookmarklets in a web dashboard, into which you sign in with your Twitter account. When you add or change a bookmarklet, it is instantly avaliable to you in all your browsers.

Try it: 

- go to http://master-bookmarket.meteor.com
- login with Twitter
- click on "Master Bookmarklet Code" and install it in your browser as a bookmarklet
- add some bookmarklets in the dashboard
- that's it!


Running the server
------------------

The app is written in meteor.js. 

To run, make sure you have Meteor and Meteorite installed and then run "mrt" in the project folder.
